        The game is drawn once neither side has made progress for long enough. Progress is a
        capture, a blast, a Legionary step or a promotion. Every turn without one adds a point to
        the count, and the next turn with one clears it. A turn is a move from each side, the way
        chess counts its fifty.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-2.5 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-ink-dim'>
        How many of those turns you are allowed is read off the board:
      </p>
      <p className='mt-2.5 font-mono text-[13px] text-ink'>
        limit = 60 + 2 &times; (52 &minus; pieces on board)
      </p>
      <p className='mt-2.5 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-ink-dim'>
        Mate takes far longer with two pieces than with twenty, so one fixed number would cut real
        endgames short and let a crowded middlegame sit still for far too long. The line runs
        between two points. At 52 pieces, the opening, it gives 60 turns, the fifty of chess
        stretched for a board 13 files wide instead of 8. At 3 pieces, a bare Pope against a Pope
        and one other, it gives 158, roughly double the longest mate this game is expected to need.
        Everything between sits on the straight line joining them, and that is all the 2 is: each
        piece that leaves the board buys two more turns.

        This one is read narrowly for now. The game is drawn on it only when the two Popes are the
